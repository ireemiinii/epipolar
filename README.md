# epipolar

ANSWER.1 )
I first uploaded the 1st image file. Then I uploaded the fundemental matrix to create the link between the two pictures. I manually selected 5 points and created a matrix with the coordinates of those points. I multiplied the point coordinates with the given matrix to find the epipolar lines. I normalized to create these epipolar lines. I have defined these equations in order to place the values I obtained into the the line equation (ax+by+c). Thanks to this equation, I got the x and y values. I had the new coordinates I had drawn on the third picture file.

ANSWER.2 )
I uploaded the image files for question 2.  Then I uploaded the fundemental matrix to create the link between the pictures. For the first picture, I manually selected 5 points and created a matrix with the coordinates of those points. I did the same for the second picture and created another matrix. I multiplied the point coordinates with the given matrixes to find the epipolar lines between 1-3 and 2-3. I normalized both pictures to create epipolar lines. I have defined these equations in order to fit these values into the line equation. I found the x and y values for 1-3. Likewise, I got the values of x and ye for 2-3. I had the new coordinates drawn on the third image file and I specified the points I had chosen.

ANSWER.3 )
We can make the accuracy of the points projected in the 3rd picture using the Least Squares estimation method. With this method, we calculate the probable locations of the points. The reasons for the projection errors are small errors in the calculation matrix between the two photographs, incorrect determination of the angle used, distortions in the pictures, the reflection of the light on the surfaces, the time and the weather in the photographs taken, the change in the intensity and the displacement of the objects (human, car, animal etc.).
